# cs103-SchoolInfoSystem
Repo holding a CS103 group project on a School Information System.

Contained within this file:
The teacher struct + constructor + function to get input for a new one

The date struct + 2 constructors (one that uses integers to create a date, and one that uses a string (formatted as dd/mm/yyyy) to create a date

A function to get an integer, with exception handling and the ability to create a min/max value for the input

A function to get user input for a password, which asks the user to re-enter their password to confirm it.


Second Commit: I have added file functionality to the program, so registered teachers remain. I am trying to add a linked list for the teachers, however have not yet succeded. Again, the program is being uploaded in a state where it does not function. The good news is, at the bottom of the teacherstruct.cpp file is a function to get int input in a range with exception handling, alongside a function to get a password from a user. Feel free to use those if you choose.
